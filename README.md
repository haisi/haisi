### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland working for [Migros Online](https://github.com/hasan-selman-kara-leshop).

Here I am doing some open source stuff. Currently I am creating an open source port of my [bachelor's thesis](https://selman.li/thesis) called [jPBE](https://selman.li/thesis).

However, usually I am just starring repos of others ðŸ˜„
